<body>
<p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Adele was born in North London, England, on May 5, 1988, eventually attending the performing arts BRIT School. Her first two albums, 19 and 21, earned her critical praise and a level of commercial success unsurpassed among her peers, with the artist selling millions of albums worldwide and winning multiple Grammys. She also received a songwriting Oscar for the James Bond track "Skyfall." After becoming a mom, Adele returned to the charts in autumn 2015 with the ballad "Hello," the lead single for her forthcoming album 25. <a href="http://adele.com/">Learn More</a></p>
